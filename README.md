TaskWarrior <--> Gmail Stars
============================

After setup, throw this sucker in your crontab to run ever now and then. Upon running:

* Newly gmail starred thread -> add as a task
* Removed gmail star (already task) -> mark task done
* Task marked as done -> remove gmail star

Which is pretty neat. Now I star a message and it magically shows up in my TODO list. If I address the message, I can either un-star it or mark it as done!
